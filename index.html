        <h1>the Desert has eyes</h1>
        <p>
            When I get to Tucson I step out of the airport into a warm evening. The scent of the rain from earlier is still in the air, the remnants of monsoons saying their final goodbye as the earth spins into fall, as I head back into the town I call home.
        </p>
        <p>
            In truth, Tucson was never meant to be home. Fearing violence and hoping to offer their children a safer life, my elders began the journey from Guanajuato, Mexico to California, where the <i>bracero</i> program and the fields overflowing with fruit promised citizenship and work. Whether it was the heat, the weight of at least six children, or simply the age of the car they had loaded their lives into, the family car barely made it over the border between the US and Mexico before breaking down. With no money remaining and a family to support, it seemed the desert, with its saguaros and javelinas, was a wonderful place to settle down. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And to me, whose eyes have never known Guanajato, the beauty of the desert overwhelms me. At first glance, the soil is red and dry, the saguaros stretch high, providing thin stripes of shadow along the terrain for whatever creature is brave enough to make the journey. Yet the bravery of the dessert can be heard as an orchestra. The desert abounds with strange little creatures who have adapted to not only survive, but to thrive, and what are we if not strange little creatures ourselves. There are hundreds of species of cacti, which deepen their roots and draw water into their hearts to save for another day. The lizards dart from burrow to burrow, and if you're lucky they might come out to greet you in the morning. Flowers bloom in vibrant color and gift their nectar to birds and bats, who dart along the mountains that envelope the land. Lives, past and present, intersect in the Sonoran. As I walk upon the land that bears so much unexpected life I'm surrounded by the memories of those who came before me.

            Growing up, I distinctly felt that the eyes of the desert, of the life forms past and present, watched over me. When I return to the desert now, the eyes feel different, disjoint.
        </p>
        <p>
            A new border wall has toppled century old saguaros; the wind now fights infrared drones, designed to detect heat that betrays the body, exposing the human body. From these artifacts, the deserts' twin emerges; a digital world built upon heaps of data encodes a landscape of humans, animals, and history.
        </p>
        <p>
            I too exist in this digital world. I consented to the facial recognition scan at the airport on my way here, knowing full well my image would be used to train and improve facial recognition technologies. When I was pulled for a random search I complied, opening my bag for search and displaying my documents again. I exist as an <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/766092/pdf" target="_blank">informational person.</a> I cannot function in this modern, colonial world without the comforts of a social security number, a bank account, a credit card. My livelihood on this land is structured by numbers and data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The land has been disrupted. The creatures of the land have been disrupted. What water falls in the desert is being used to cool datacenters. Fiber optic cables root themselves through the Sonora, transporting data for new machine learning algorithms, which may or may not be used for surveillance <a href="https://www.404media.co/you-cant-refuse-to-be-scanned-by-ices-facial-recognition-app-dhs-document-says/">(which you can't refuse).</a> Though I'm sure the official word is that the investment in artificial intelligence is simply for the safety of the people. No. <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trumps-executive-order-limits-state-regulations-of-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">You really shouldn't question it.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            And for the longest time, I didn't question it. I studied computer science, one of the “most colonial disciplines to exist” according to one of my professors. I lived as a <a href="http://hyle.mobi/Reading_Groups/Concerning%20Violence,%20Frantz%20Fanon/" target="_blank">colonized intellectual,</a> believing I could one day be powerful under capitalism*. That I could build the future and change the world*. though truly I was simply building digital structures that upheld an existing system of imperialism and destruction.
            <br>
            <small>*and happen to profit on the way</small>
        </p>
        <p>
            Truthfully, I have no idea what comes next. If I wish to truly decolonize, I must refuse racial capitalism and I'm not certain what that looks like. I stand equipped with many of the master's tools and as Audre Lorde <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/audre-lorde-the-master-s-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-master-s-house" target="_blank">wrote,</a> “the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house; they may allow us to temporarily beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change.” I can make databases, I can use amazon web services, I wrote this very website, but how does any of this become an act of resistance, refusal?
