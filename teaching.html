    <p>I believe that computing is deeply intertwined with social contexts and it should be taught as such. In practicing this belief, my teaching is often sociotechnical in nature, and I love to teach introductory computing, data science, and social theory courses.</p>
    <i>To date, I have served as a TA for the following courses:</i>
    <div class="teaching-history">
        <b><a href="https://cs195.org/fa25/" target="_blank">CS195:</a> Social Implications of Computing</b>
        <i>I gained a lot of experience with logistics as the Head TA (& onyl TA) for this course of ~150 students. I had a great time selecting some of the readings for the course & leading the honors discussion section</i>
    </div>
    <div class="teaching-history">
        <b>CS 375: Teaching Techniques for Computer Science</b>
        <i>A required course for all first-time TAs at Berkeley. I gave several guest mini-lectures on pedagogy for this course & had a wonderful time hearing everyone's unique pedagogical thoughts</i>
    </div>
    <div class="teaching-history">
        <b><a href="https://data104.org/" target="_blank">Data C104:</a> Human Contexts and Ethics of Data</b>
        <i>I served as a TA for two semesters and quickly realized teaching social theory is quite different from teaching technical material, though both are fun! I learned so much about creating fun discussion spaces and engagign activities to encourage participation.</i>

    <div class="teaching-history">
        <b><a href="https://sp24.datastructur.es/" target="_blank">CS 61B:</a> Data Structures</b>
        <i>Lots of problem walkthroughs on the board & I learned how to draw graphs nicely. I led a discussion section for students from underrepresented backgrounds in computing and actively worked on building community through peer instruction and creating space for culturally relevant topics, such as resources on campus or real-world uses of data structures. In my evaluations, a student noted "[abby] has a strong understanding of social justice and she interacts with students with a purpose," which may seem out of place for a data structures class, but I feel social justice is quite relevant to computing</i>

    <div class="teaching-history">
        <b><a href="https://cs61a.org/" target="_blank">CS 61A:</a> Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</b>
        <i>The first class I ever taught, which also taught me so much! I loved meeting students just beginning their journey in computing and offering support. One student wrote in my evaluations that I "made [them] feel included in a class filled with people who were doing way better than [them]," which is just one instance of how prevalent imposter syndrome is in CS. I care deeply about ensuring that students feel comfortable asking questions and gain not only technical skills, but confidence as well.</i>
